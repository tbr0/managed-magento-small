# managed-magento-small
For now ignore the "stackCreate.sh" script. I have not updated the parameters yet and this was just for quick testing with the heat client.

I'll improve it later for CLI users.

For now just take the managed-magento-small.yml, go to raw link, and copy/paste it into the heat orchestration template area.

Thanks!
